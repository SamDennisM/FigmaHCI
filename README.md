## ✨ **Overview**

**Yummy** is a high-fidelity prototype of a food delivery application created with a user-centered design approach.  
The project translates the needs, goals, and frustrations of the defined user persona into a polished, intuitive, and modern UI.  

The prototype captures the entire core flow:

- Home screen  
- Category navigation  
- Search experience  
- Cart and checkout  
- Location change after placing an order  
- Clean login & onboarding  

The result is a visually refined, persona-driven product that feels realistic and production-ready.

## 🎯 **Design Principles Applied**

### **1️⃣ Consistency**
Uniform icon style, typography, colors, and layout across all screens create predictability.

### **2️⃣ Visibility of System Status**
Delivery times, cart value, item count, and payment method remain clearly visible to reduce uncertainty.

### **3️⃣ Feedback**
Button state changes, updated address display, cart item count increments—every action gets a visible response.

### **4️⃣ User Control & Flexibility**
Users can:
- Change location anytime  
- Edit items  
- Modify quantities  
- Add promo codes  
- Select or update payment modes  

### **5️⃣ Aesthetic & Minimalist Design**
Clean spacing, limited color palette, simple layout, and clutter-free screens enhance readability and reduce cognitive load.
